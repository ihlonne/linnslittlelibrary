# Linn's Little Library

This book finder app is a project made to develop my skills as a React developer.

## Overview

### About

This is a generator that pulls data from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) and the [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app on Desktop.
-   See hover states for interactive elements (search bar and search icon).
-   Search for books by title or author.
-   Generate a new quote by making a new search or refreshing the page.
-   Click available links.
-   See more results by using the pagination.

## My process

### Built with

-   React
-   Google Books API
-   Google Firebase Realtime Database
-   Material UI
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Asynchronous JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first time making a React app that isn't from a tutorial so it's safe to say I learnt a lot.

I have learnt how to fetch data with two different APIs, one from Google Books where I received data about volumes and one from Google Firebase where I received a random bookish quote from a Realtime Database made by me.

Not only have I learnt how to use React and to fetch data with APIs, I also used Material UI to build this project. This helped me learn how to read documentation and to do my own research.

Overall, I think this project has been an amazing learning experience. I gave myself one week to finish, and I managed in four days. I now feel more confident using React, APIs and Material UI.

### Continued development

Ideas to improve the application:

-   Incorporate the option to add books to personal shelves.
-   Add books to show immediately upon arriving to the page (maybe five latest releases, most popular, etc.).
-   Switch to Goodreads' API.

## My process

A month ago, I hardly knew React; I had followed one tutorial but knew practically nothing.
